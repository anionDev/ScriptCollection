# Required tools for CommonProjectStructure

## Hints

[ScriptCollection](https://github.com/anionDev/ScriptCollection) contains scripts to implement a repository-structure defined by the [`CommonProjectStructure`](<https://projects.aniondev.de/PublicProjects/Common/ProjectTemplates/-/blob/main/Conventions/RepositoryStructure/CommonProjectStructure/CommonProjectStructure.md>).
To be able to run the scripts specified by the `CommonProjectStructure` successfully some tools may be required dependent on your project.
For typically used tools the [Tools](#tools)-section contains a short description how to install them.

### Requirements

### Configuration

#### localhost.private-hosts-entry

`*.localtest.me` is a not-existing domain which can be used to host a HTTPS-server with a trusted certificate on the local development machine.
For this reason you have to add an entry like `127.0.0.1 *.localtest.me` to the hosts-file on your local development-machine.
After this the scripts inside of the code-unit can generate a certificate for the domain `codeunitname*.localtest.me` which can be used for local development-purposes.
See the [ReadMe](https://readme.localtest.me/) for more information.
